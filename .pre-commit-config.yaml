# Pre-commit hooks for lb-ri-utils
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
#
# NOTE: When hooks modify files, pre-commit will "fail" and abort the commit.
# This is expected behavior - it allows you to review the changes.
# Simply run `git add -u && git commit` again. The second attempt will succeed
# because the files are already correctly formatted/updated.
